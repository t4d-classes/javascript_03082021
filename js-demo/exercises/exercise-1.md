# Exercise 1

1. Create an array of car objects. Each car should have an id, make, model, year, price.

2. Write three functions: appendCar, replaceCar, and removeCar. All three functions should receive the array of cars as the first parameter. Supply additional parameters based upon what the function needs.

appendCar: receive a new car object, generate an id, immutable add it to the list, and return the new list array

replaceCar: receive a modified car object, and replace a car with the specified id

removeCar: pass in the car id to remove, and return a new array with the car removed

All operations should be done immutably.

3. Display all of the cars in the console. Do not use the "traditional" for loop. Do not use map, filter or reduce to display the cars. Instead, search the JavaScript documentation (Google) a more declarative approach for displaying the list.

4. Ensure it works!
